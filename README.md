# unity-mac-webcam-plugin

This project is webcam plugin in Unity on macOS. The Unity provides WebcamTexture, but it has a bug causing crashes. 
The bug is, if another app opens webcam which is used by an unity app, then the unity app craches.  

I made this plugin for workaround of the issue. If anyone have the same issue, please use this.
